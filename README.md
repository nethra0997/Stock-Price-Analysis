# Stock-Price-Analysis
This project explores various techniques for analyzing stock price data using Python. It includes data loading, descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and visualization of stock prices. The project leverages libraries such as pandas and plotly to provide comprehensive insights into stock market trends.


## Data Loading:
Loaded a dataset of stock prices from a CSV file.

## Descriptive Statistics:
Calculated descriptive statistics for each stock, including mean, standard deviation, percentiles, and extreme values.
Provided a detailed summary for each stock ticker, such as AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, and NFLX.

## Time Series Analysis:
### Converted date columns to datetime objects for accurate time series analysis.

### Created a pivot table for closing prices of different stock tickers.

### Generated interactive time series plots to visualize the trends and patterns of stock prices over time using plotly.

## Visualization:
Created a subplot to display the time series of closing prices for each stock.
Updated the layout to include titles for the plot, x-axis, y-axis, and legend for better readability and interpretation.
